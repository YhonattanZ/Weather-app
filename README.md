# Weather-app
A simple weather app, which shows temperature, icons and High/Low temperature of the week.


Hi! My name is Yhonattan Zambrano, a junior Flutter developer.

This app has some functionalities like geolocation, local notifications.

The API that I used in this project is : https://www.metaweather.com/api/

Is an simple API with a nice documentation, that I recommended 100%.
